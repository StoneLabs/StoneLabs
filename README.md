I'm coding mostly for fun. Currently, I'm studying Space and Aerospace Information Technology at JMU wÃ¼rzburg and work as a Network Engineer and System Integrator. I enjoy designing PCB's (though I wouldn't say I'm very good at it), creating embedded systems, coding python/cpp, and some opsec. I love attending Hackathons and building some crazy stuff.
